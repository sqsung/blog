Hello world! I’m James, a software engineer passionate about building user-focused products with innovative business models.

I started my career as a startup founder with a business degree. In efforts to better communicate with the developers on the team, I began to study programming after work — and unexpectedly found myself drawn to it. That spark of interest turned into a career change, and I’ve been a full-time developer ever since.

Currently, I work at a silver tech startup in Seoul, engineering tools to help families stay connected with their elderly loved ones and their caregivers — a growing challenge in one of the world's fastest-aging societies.

Outside of work, I like to experiment with side projects. I often take problems I’ve encountered on the job and rebuild them in new ways, applying the insights back to my work.

I'm not a prolific writer, but I use this blog to capture what I’ve learned. It’s mostly for personal reference — but if it helps you in any way, even better.
