Hello world! I’m James, a software engineer passionate about building user-focused products with innovative business models.

I started my professional life as an entrepreneur with a business degree.
I initially began learning programming simply because I was struggling to communicate with the developers on my team.
But somewhere along the way, I found myself genuinely drawn to it.
This spark of interest eventually fledged into a career change, and I’ve been a full-time developer ever since.

Currently, I work at a silver tech startup in Seoul, engineering tools to help families stay connected with their elderly loved ones and their caregivers — a growing challenge in one of the world's fastest-aging societies.

Outside of work, I like to experiment with side projects. I often take problems I’ve encountered on the job and rebuild them in new ways, applying the insights back to my work.

I'm not a prolific writer, but I do plan to use this blog to capture what I’ve learned. It’s mainly for personal reference — but if it helps you in any way, couldn't be happier.
