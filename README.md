Welcome to jsjs.blog, a blog made from scractch with Next.js and TailwindCSS! I got carried away reading Next.js official documentation, particularly intrigued by the section that generously provides guidelines for creating a blog. Following their guidelines and more, I dove deeper and carried through with finishing the blog while exploiting every step of the process to grasp an understanding of how Next.js works.
